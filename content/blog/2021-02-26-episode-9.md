## The doctrine of free will

> 16 Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
>
> ###### Genesis 2:16-17

The Bible also says that "Whosoever calls upon the Name of the Lord Jesus will be saved" in Romans chapter 10.   Does this really mean whosoever?  Do we have freedom to make this choice?  In this episode we will explain how by giving Adam a free choice, we too can appreciate our own free choice.

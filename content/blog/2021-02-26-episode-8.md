God is complete in and of Himself. He lacks nothing and therefore anything that He has created is a demonstration of His own goodness and should reflect His infinite worth.  Man pursuing works doesn’t fit this particular picture very well and so what we need to do is look deeper into God’s intent for man in Genesis chapter 2, in the Garden of Eden – the spot where God dwelt and fellow-shipped with him.   Chapters 2 and 3 are finer details inserted into the larger overview of Chapter 1.  Details that give us specific insights into something that must be rather important for us to know…

> 10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers. 11 The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12 and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium\[b] and onyx stone are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 15 Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to *worship and serve*

God has appeared in human form. He didnâ€™t just do it for 30-some years 2000 years ago, but He walked among men since the time of Adam and He appeared throughout the ages to His people as the Bible records.

Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.

> Genesis 18:1

Yahweh is the Lord, the Lord who is Jehovah God the physical manifestation of God.

**Jesus is the Lord!!!**

## The end of the garden of God

> 16 To the woman he said,\
> “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.\
>     You will bear children in pain.\
> Your desire will be for your husband,\
>     and he will rule over you.”
>
> 17 To Adam he said,\
> “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,\
>     and have eaten from the tree,\
>     about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’\
>     the ground is cursed for your sake.\
> You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.
>
> 18     It will yield thorns and thistles to you;\
>     and you will eat the herb of the field.
>
> 19 You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,\
>     for you were taken out of it.\
> For you are dust,\
>     and you shall return to dust.”
>
> 20 The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living.

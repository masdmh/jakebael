Listen to this episode to learn how the stage is being set for the invasion of Israel as written by Ezekiel under the Spirit of God in Chapter 38 and take comfort from the inclusion of a reading of Isaiah 35 and Isaiah 40.   

This special episode describes how the Afghanistan crisis can be understood through the lens of Bible Prophecy.   The Biblical analysis behind this as well as much the material used are sourced from  [Dr Andy Wood's PASTORS POINT OF VIEW](https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/97d3232f-102a-49c7-a873-35f8a0efb18b/dr-andy-woods-pastor's-point-of-view)  podcast episodes 176 (August 20, 2022) and 177 (August 27, 2022)

We agree with his excellent commentary and you should check out all his materials at SPIRIT and TRUTH.org and his many well written and accurate Bible books.  We have made this episode to help share this important perspective with the BIBLE IN TEN community..

> Some see similarities between what happened in the US with Jimmy carter and Biden administrations.   Inflation in Carter years, and we have inflation now.  Secondly the removal of energy independence â€“ this was happening in the Carter years and Biden has annexed the keystone pipeline, so that energy independence has gone.   Also under Jimmy Carter, Persia moved from an ally to Israel and the United States to becoming an enemy of United States and Islamified becoming hostile to the nation of Israel.   This is what is happening in Afghanistan currently.

> The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan because of the American withdrawal makes it seem like history is repeating itself.  As Solomon writes, "there is nothing new under the sun".

Thus begins a series of 1010 episodes detailing the Book of Acts, verse by verse each day.Â 

Acts is a book that must be considered carefully. It is certain that almost all major theological errors within the church arise by a misapplication, or a misuse, of the book of Acts.

If the book is taken in its proper light, it is an invaluable tool for understanding what God is doing in the redemptive narrative in human history. If it is taken incorrectly, failed doctrine, and even heretical ideas, will arise (and consistently have arisen) within the church.

Let us consider the book of Acts in its proper light. In doing so, these errors in thinking and theology will be avoided.

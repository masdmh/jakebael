An early lesson about the futility in attempting to overcome our deficiencies with works without faith.

>  7 Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves. 8 They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
>
> 9 Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”
>
> 10 The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
>
> 11 God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
>
> 12 The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
>
> 13 Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”
>
> The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

> 14 Yahweh God said to the serpent,
>
> “Because you have done this,\
>     you are cursed above all livestock,\
>     and above every animal of the field.\
> You shall go on your belly\
>     and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.\
> 15 I will put hostility between you and the woman,\
>     and between your offspring and her offspring.\
> He will bruise your head,\
>     and you will bruise his heel.”
>
> ###### Genesis 3:14:15



###### Psalm 22 is worth posting here too, since it gives the first person account of being upon the cross, which surely includes a bruising of a heel as a nail is driven in.

> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\
>     Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?\
> 2 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;\
>     in the night season, and am not silent.\
> 3 But you are holy,\
>     you who inhabit the praises of Israel.\
> 4 Our fathers trusted in you.\
>     They trusted, and you delivered them.\
> 5 They cried to you, and were delivered.\
>     They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.\
> 6 But I am a worm, and no man;\
>     a reproach of men, and despised by the people.\
> 7 All those who see me mock me.\
>     They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,\
> 8     “He trusts in Yahweh.\
>     Let him deliver him.\
>     Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”\
> 9 But you brought me out of the womb.\
>     You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.\
> 10 I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.\
>     You are my God since my mother bore me.\
> 11 Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.\
>     For there is no one to help.\
> 12 Many bulls have surrounded me.\
>     Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.\
> 13 They open their mouths wide against me,\
>     lions tearing prey and roaring.\
> 14 I am poured out like water.\
>     All my bones are out of joint.\
> My heart is like wax.\
>     It is melted within me.\
> 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd.\
>     My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.\
> You have brought me into the dust of death.\
> 16 For dogs have surrounded me.\
>     A company of evildoers have enclosed me.\
>     They have pierced my hands and feet.[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+22&version=web#fen-WEB-14221a "See footnote a")]\
> 17 I can count all of my bones.\
> They look and stare at me.\
> 18 They divide my garments among them.\
>     They cast lots for my clothing.
>
> 19 But don’t be far off, Yahweh.\
>     You are my help. Hurry to help me!\
> 20 Deliver my soul from the sword,\
>     my precious life from the power of the dog.\
> 21 Save me from the lion’s mouth!\
>     Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.
>
> 22 I will declare your name to my brothers.\
>     Among the assembly, I will praise you.\
> 23 You who fear Yahweh, praise him!\
>     All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!\
>     Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!\
> 24 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,\
>     Neither has he hidden his face from him;\
>     but when he cried to him, he heard.
>
> 25 My praise of you comes in the great assembly.\
>     I will pay my vows before those who fear him.\
> 26 The humble shall eat and be satisfied.\
>     They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him.\
>     Let your hearts live forever.\
> 27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.\
>     All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.\
> 28 For the kingdom is Yahweh’s.\
>     He is the ruler over the nations.\
> 29 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.\
>     All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,\
>     even he who can’t keep his soul alive.\
> 30 Posterity shall serve him.\
>     Future generations shall be told about the Lord.\
> 31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,\
>     for he has done it.
